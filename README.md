This was forked from our existing repository to be hosted on my Github Pages as a project example. 

Information  on the Project
===========================

For more info on the project itself, and our ideation process, see [this](https://tyler-duckworth.github.io/2019/02/10/allergps/) blog post.


## The Below is the ReadME of the original repo.

To All CodeTN Judges:
---------------------
This website is hosted on a server [here](https://www.allergps.com)

Restarting the server can be done in two ways:
1. Click the icon in the top right-hand corner of the workspace that 
shows the Memory, CPU, and Disk usage on the server. Go down to
the gray button that says `Restart`. 
2. Alternatively, you can click the button in the main ribbon that says **`Cloud9`**
and scroll down to the button that says **`Restart Workspace`**. Agree with any permissions needed 
to restart the server.

During the competition we would like to use the version of the site that is hosted on github due to its reliability. 


If this does not work, email me at <s848387@student.knoxschools.org> for a copy of the source code of the website.
